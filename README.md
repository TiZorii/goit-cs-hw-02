# "Operating Systems Fundamentals"

This homework assignment consists of two independent tasks aimed at using the Bash command line to automate processes and deepen my understanding of Docker and containerization.

---

## What I'll Practice:

- Interacting with the operating system via the command line, specifically by creating Bash scripts and using the `curl` command â€” a powerful CLI tool for interacting with web servers, particularly for making HTTP requests.
- Setting up and using Docker Compose to manage an environment that includes both an application and a PostgreSQL database.

---

By completing this assignment, I'll gain:

- Practical skills for working with operating systems and networks.
- Hands-on experience containerizing a FastAPI application along with its PostgreSQL database.

Let's get started!
